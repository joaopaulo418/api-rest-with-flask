# üß† Study Project: User Management API

This is a personal project aimed at studying and practicing the main methods of a REST API using Flask. The application simulates a user management system, allowing you to **create, update, remove and query data** in a simple and organized way.

## üì° HTTP Methods Used

| Method | Purpose                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | Fetch one or all users               |
| `POST` | Create a new user                    |

## üîÄ API Routes

The API base route is `/user`. Individual user manipulation is done by including the `id` at the end of the route:

| Method | Route           | Description                               |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/user`         | Creates a new user                       |
| `GET`  | `/user`         | Returns **all users**                    |
| `GET`  | `/user/<id>`    | Returns a **specific user** by ID        |
| `PUT`  | `/user/<id>`    | **Completely** updates a user            |
| `PATCH`| `/user/<id>`    | **Partially** updates a user             |
| `DELETE`| `/user/<id>`   | Removes a user from the system           |
