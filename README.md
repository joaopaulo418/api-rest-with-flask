# Study Project: User Management API

This is a personal project aimed at studying and practicing the main methods of a REST API using Flask. The application simulates a user and company management system, allowing you to **create, update, remove and query data** in a simple and organized way.

- 🛠️ **Partially** update user or company information (`PATCH`)
- 🗑️ Remove a user or company (when removing a company, all associated users will be removed) (`DELETE`)
